# Module 5 introduction

The upgrades to the Hardware Handler app are well underway now.

In our last module, we went through each class component, refactoring them to use hooks and improving the code's quality and flow thanks to ESLint.

Now, it's time to take it one step further and find instances where we're duplicating code across components, or we've got extra-large components that could do with some simplification. This type of code presents prime opportunities to be refactored into custom hooks.

This module will cover:

- Identifying duplicate code across components that are good candidates to be refactored into custom hooks
- Simplifying large, complicated components with lots of code by moving some of it out into separate hooks
- Leveraging hooks to work across multiple components, ultimately letting us delete code that becomes unnecessary

Are you ready to get even more confident with hooks?
