# Module 9 introduction

At this point, you could call Hardware Handler complete. It's been upgraded, refactored, tested, and made ready to continue running for a good long while, but as an enterprise application, there's a good chance a design system will come into play at some point in this app's life.

Design systems can be extremely useful not just for the development team but also for designers who work with them. They can play an especially important role in large organizations with lots of development teams and lots of designers when it comes to making separate apps have a similar look and feel regardless of who designed and built it.

But as with most things, design systems may not be implemented at the outset of a project â€” they may be added midway through, so knowing how to incorporate and leverage them for maximum effect is worth covering. Not to mention learning to read and understand the docs that come along with a typical design system.

In this final, bonus module, we'll look at a very popular React design system, Ant Design, incorporate it into Hardware Handler, and swap out some of our custom components of varying complexity with equivalent AntD components.

We will:

- Discuss the benefits design systems and introduce some of the best options out there for React applications
- Add the Ant Design system to our application and set up our already-chosen color scheme as the defaults in Ant
- Learn strategies to begin swapping out custom components in the app with more standardized AntD components, working our way up from simple components to more complex ones.
