# Module 9 summary

This lesson is a summary of what we've covered in module 9.0.

In this module, we learned:

## Why design systems are valuable for whole organizations, not just developers, and some popular options

Design systems have really been catching on in recent years because they can take the place of _both_ style guides for the marketing team _and_ pattern libraries for the development teams.

Not only that, but design systems help speed up design and development time, cut down on technical debt, provide a more consistent user experience across products, and generally lead to better products by allowing people to focus on solving end-user problems instead of implementation details.

And some of the best and brightest companies are making their design systems widely available: Google's Material UI, IBM's Carbon Design System, and Uber's Base Web, to name just a few.

## How to incorporate the Ant Design system with our application and configure it to our color palette

Ant Design is a very popular design system today that's highly customizable and highly extensible to fit many different needs.

Because of its flexibility, getting started with it takes a little doing and a good bit of initial configuration.

In this lesson, we downloaded Ant, added its CSS libraries to Hardware Handler, and then made the extra effort to add CRACO so that we could use our own chosen color scheme instead of Ant's defaults.

## The process to swap simple custom components out for Ant Design components

AntD offers a _large_ library of custom React components to choose from and good documentation to help show the different options and customizations available to them.

We swapped out simple elements like buttons and toasts — and revealed how using Ant can save on JavaScript code, CSS code, and even the number of additional libraries needed for certain elements.

## How to read the Ant Docs and use more complex Ant components in Hardware Handler

In our final lesson, we tackled using Ant components for more complex elements like forms and multi-filter checkbox groups.

Although these elements weren't as straightforward to replace, through a combination of reading the Ant Docs, example code, and trial and error, we ultimately ended up with a good deal less code for the same functionality and a more consistent design.

## Next module: Course wrap up

Congratulations! You did it — you made it through the bonus module of this course. This is a fantastic accomplishment.

In the final lesson in our next module, I'll recap all that we've done over the many lessons of this course.
