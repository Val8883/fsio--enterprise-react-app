# Module 4 introduction

It's finally time to begin upgrading our app, Hardware Handler!

We've played with some small samples of hooks in previous modules, we've upgraded our own app to work with hooks, and we've added project configurations and tooling and linting and code formatting. It's time to modernize these class components.

In this module, we'll:

- Learn the "recipe" I use to refactor class components
- Go through each of our class-based components, turn them into functional components while ensuring the functionality remains the same (or improves), and fix any ESLint errors to make our code quality better
- Build up our confidence with hooks by converting our simpler class components first and working up to our complex components that will need a good bit of rewriting to utilize hooks

By the end, I hope you'll feel much more prepared to take on React components in whatever form you encounter them in the wild.
