# Module 4 summary

This lesson is a summary of what we've covered in Module 4.0.

In this module, we learned:

## A "recipe" to convert class components to functional components

Over time, I've developed a methodical way that I prefer to convert React class components to React functional components using hooks.

It's certainly not the only way to do things, but it's a good way to start when you're getting more familiar with using hooks.

## How to take existing class components and update them

We worked our way through the app's class components one by one and turned them into functional components with hooks.

Each component got progressively more complex, but each lesson gave us more experience to build upon, more confidence to understand and fix ESLint errors, and more opportunities to see the advantages and simplicity hooks offer over class components.

## Next module: Add custom hooks to our app

We've gotten a good taste of putting basic React Hooks to use as we refactored the components in our app. Now it's time to take it up a notch and start writing some custom Hooks for our app,

This should really help solidify our confidence in recognizing when and how to use hooks.
