# Module 3 introduction

Now that our app has been upgraded to the latest version of React, and we've dialed in our project tooling so that any developer joining the team would have to actively work to use a version of Node or Yarn different from everyone else's, you might think you're ready to start developing.

But I'd argue that there are two more things we need to do before we start upgrading the app: set up both our Prettier and ESLint project-wide configurations.

Almost the first thing I do after starting a new project is add these two files because they make my development experience so much more pleasant, _and_ they help me write better code.

In this module, we'll:

- Learn about why code formatting can dramatically improve a project, how Prettier's opinionated take is the right choice to make, and configure it in our application so that it reformats our code automatically.
- Discuss the reasoning behind ESLint, look into the most popular ESLint setup for React, and add that to our project too so that we can improve our code's quality as we develop.

T> For the lessons in this module, I highly recommend you use the [VSCode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development.
T>
T> While you can still take advantage of both Prettier and ESLint without it, some of the configurations I'll do involve plugins from the [VSCode Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) that really enhance the development experience with both.
