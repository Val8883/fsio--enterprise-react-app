# Although Hardware Handler doesn't look so different on the surface, it's a whole new app underneath

Congratulations once again on making it to the end of this course! It's been quite a journey.

Part of working with large enterprise apps means maintaining them — oftentimes for years after they were originally built. And when apps get this big and this old, sometimes they're not the best-maintained things in the world.

I hope after this course, you feel more confident about taking on (and improving) any React project you come across in the future — no matter what state it might be in. This is by no means an exhaustive course of _everything_, but it should give you a base to start from.

## What we learned

- All about React Hooks, including the most common ones you'll reach for on a daily basis
- How to upgrade an outdated React app and lock down its tooling dependencies going forward
- How to configure Prettier and ESLint to improve the developer experience through automated code formatting and linting
- A strategy to refactor old-style React class components to use React Hooks instead
- How to create custom hooks to make app functionality more reusable and concise
- How to leverage the context API to make state management within the app cleaner
- How to give ourselves more confidence in our code's functionality by adding integration tests with React Testing Library and Jest
- How to complete end-to-end tests with Cypress.io to test the full experience as a user would
- Finally, how to take advantage of the Ant Design system to simplify the code we have to write by leveraging Ant components instead

## Thank you

Thank you so much for joining me for this course! It's been a pleasure to share some of the things I've learned over years of working with large React code bases — I hope you think so, too.
