# Module 1 Introduction

In the last module, I introduced the existing application and briefly talked about the hows and whys of its structure.

The app is an example of what you might encounter in an enterprise-level organization: it's a fully functional React application, but it's outdated. Even though it's using the Create React App framework (designed to make it easy to take advantage of improvements to React), it has not kept up with the new releases as they've come along â€” the most obvious one being React Hooks.

Time to upgrade and reap the many benefits hooks bring to the React framework, the most notable being that hooks let you use more of React's features without classes (which, in my opinion, makes the code easier to read and write).

In this module, we'll take a look at React Hooks, the biggest fundamental change to happen to React since its inception, to better understand the whys and hows of the hooks you'll see (and use) the most frequently in the wild. We'll cover:

- Why hooks? What benefits do hooks bring to React? Why should I bother upgrading?
- The most commonly used React Hooks:
  - useState Hook
  - useEffect Hook
  - useRef Hook
  - useContext Hook
  - Custom hooks
